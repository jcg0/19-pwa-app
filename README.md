# 19-pwa-app

## Description

In this assignment we needed to add in some code to the PWA app to use webpack and be able to use the app when in offline mode. We also needed to add some installation functionality so the app can be used outside of the browser. This challenge was tough. I was not very confident in my skills with webpack. I was able to use the help from my tutor to get the functionality working. In the end it was an interesting challenge and it was cool seeing all the ways webpack is used.
